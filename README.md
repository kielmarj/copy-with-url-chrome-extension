# Copy with URL Chrome Extension

<p><img  style="float:left;width:48px;height:48px;" src="icon128.png">This is a straightforward chrome extension that automatically includes the URL of a page when you copy text to the clipboard.

## Installation

This is my first chrome extension, and I am still looking into putting it on the Chrome Web Store. If you would like to use this extension in the meantime, you can install it by following these steps:

1. ```
   git clone https://github.com/kielmarj/copy-with-url-chrome-extension
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click `load unpacked` and select the copy-with-url-chrome-extension folder

## Usage

Use Alt+C or Right-click > 'Copy with URL' to copy selected text. The URL will be preprended to your copied text.

### Customization

Visit the 'Options' page for the extension to specify your preferred format. Choose from:
  - Markdown. Pasted texted example:
    ```markdown
    [Page title](https://www.example.com)

    Copied text here ...
    ```
  - HTML. Pasted text example:
    ```html
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Page title</a><br>
	
	Copied text here ...
    ```
  - Plain text. Pasted text example:
    ```txt
    Page title - https://www.example.com

    Copied text here ...
    ```
If not configured, the default format is plain text.

Optionally, you can prefix the URL with text of your choice, such as "Source:". This can be configured on the 'Options' page as well.
